# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains my personal implementations of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms from scratch as I learn. Stay tuned for more... 

I frequently update this repository.




#### 1. Build Reinforcement Learning Environments
- \([Notebook](https://github.com/karthikraja95/Deep-RL/blob/master/1.MDP_Implementation.ipynb))
  - Implementations of several MDPs: 
    - Bandit Walk
    - Bandit Slippery Walk
    - Slippery Walk Three
    - Random Walk
    - Russell and Norvig's Gridworld from AIMA
    - FrozenLake
    - FrozenLake8x8
#### 2. Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement and Policy Iteration
- \([Notebook](https://github.com/karthikraja95/Deep-RL/blob/master/2.Policy-Iteration.ipynb))
  - Frozen Lake Environment (Gym)
    - Policy Evaluation
